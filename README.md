# UFO Finder website - added functionality

## Overview
The purpose behind these proposed modifications is to allow a user greater handling of the filtering criteria. Additional fields allow a user to filter based on geographical and encouter types and set up multi-part filtering conditions.

## Results
User experience is now more dynamic. Instead of an extra step of hitting a button a user may enter search terms across a numbers of fields to narrow the result table. Filtering is executed as a user interacts with the filter search features.

## Summary
A drawback of the page is that while the capaicty of interactive filtering has increasd it still dosn't account for every available field. We could create new boxes to filter for 'duration' and within the 'comments'.

Room for improvement could include the result table reserving space for any images of the incident, amongst other detail. Additionally, allowing for a 'date range' instead of a strict day of 'date' field would be more research appropriate.
